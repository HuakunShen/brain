Natural Language Understanding
## "Hierarchies" of Understanding
Humans can understand languages on multiple “levels”. 
- These levels are not mutually exclusive!
- Many NLP tasks require understanding at multiple levels (e.g., translation).
- These levels are here for organizing the tasks.
### Hierarchies
- Syntax
- Semantics
- Discourse
- Commonsense
- Pragmatics

#### Syntax: sequence tagging


#### Semantics: vector embedding


#### Discourse


#### Understanding the commonse
GPT-3 davinci-001 shows some evidence of understanding on commonsense.

#### Understand the Pragmatics
- Same sentence, different effects to different audience
	- High-context culture vs low-context culture
