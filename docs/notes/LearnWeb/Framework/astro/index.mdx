## State

Astro supports multiple UI frameworks simultaneously. Svelte has its own store, Vue has pinia, React has Redux and zustand.

When multiple UI frameworks are used in the same project, the state management of the project becomes a problem.

**Share state between Islands:** https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/sharing-state-islands/

> When building an Astro website with [islands architecture / partial hydration](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/), you may have run into this problem: I want to share state between my components.

[Nano Stores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) is Astro's recommended client-side storage solution.

Nano stores supports many frameworks and can be imported into the components of different frameworks.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="react" label="React" default>
    ```jsx
    import { useStore } from '@nanostores/react';
    import { isCartOpen } from '../cartStore';

    export default function CartButton() {
      // read the store value with the `useStore` hook
      const $isCartOpen = useStore(isCartOpen);
      // write to the imported store using `.set`
      return (
        <button onClick={() => isCartOpen.set(!$isCartOpen)}>Cart</button>
      )
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="svelte" label="svelte">
    ```jsx
    <script>
    import { isCartOpen } from '../cartStore';
    </script>

    <!--use "$" to read the store value-->
    <button on:click={() => isCartOpen.set(!$isCartOpen)}>Cart</button>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
