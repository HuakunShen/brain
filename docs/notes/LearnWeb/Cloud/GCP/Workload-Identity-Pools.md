title: Workload Identity Federation (WIF)

> Workload Identity allows your workloads to access Google Cloud without Service Account keys.

It's a new way to do authentication and authorization. 
Before, anyone with the server account credentials can access the resource, with WIF, only certified issuer like AWS and GitHub can get a short-lived access token.
