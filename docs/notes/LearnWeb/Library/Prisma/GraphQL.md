# GraphQL
[Documentation](https://www.prisma.io/graphql)
> Query data from MySQL, PostgreSQL & SQL Server databases in GraphQL with Prisma â€“ a better ORM for JavaScript and TypeScript.

## [TypeGraphQL & Prisma integration](https://github.com/MichalLytek/typegraphql-prisma#readme)

> Note that you can also use the typegraphql-prisma integration to auto-generate your GraphQL types and CRUD resolvers from the Prisma schema. This is especially helpful during prototyping and rapid development cycles.
