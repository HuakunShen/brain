# Builder

> **Builder** is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

## Problem

Imagine a very complex object that requires lots of configuration parameters.

### Potential Solutions:

1. Many parameters could be optional. One simple solution is to make an abstract base class, and make many variants
   subclasses that extend the base class. The drawback is that there may be too many subclasses.
2. A large constructor with many (optional) parameters. Resulting in very ugly code.

## Solution

- Extract object construction code to separate objects called *builders*
- Execute a series of steps on a builder object to create an object, but not all steps need to be run.
- Some construction steps require different implementation, so you need to create several different builder classes that
  implement the same set of building steps.
- Optional: extract the series of calls to the builder steps to a *Director* class. *Director* defines the order of
  building steps execution. This can hide building details from client.

1. **Builder** interface declares product construction steps that are common to all types of builders.
2. **Concrete Builders** provide different implementations of the construction steps. Concrete builders may produce
   products that don’t follow the common interface.
3. **Products** are resulting objects. Products constructed by different builders don’t have to belong to the same class
   hierarchy or interface.
4. The **Director** class defines the order in which to call construction steps, so you can create and reuse specific
   configurations of products. See [code](#director)
5. The **Client** must associate one of the builder objects with the director.

## Sample Code

### Builders

```java
/**
 * Builder interface defines all possible ways to configure a product.
 */
public interface Builder {
    void setCarType(CarType type);

    void setSeats(int seats);

    void setEngine(Engine engine);

    void setTransmission(Transmission transmission);

    void setTripComputer(TripComputer tripComputer);

    void setGPSNavigator(GPSNavigator gpsNavigator);
}

/**
 * Concrete builders implement steps defined in the common interface.
 */
public class CarBuilder implements Builder {
    private CarType type;
    private int seats;
    private Engine engine;
    private Transmission transmission;
    private TripComputer tripComputer;
    private GPSNavigator gpsNavigator;

    public void setCarType(CarType type) {
        this.type = type;
    }

    @Override
    public void setSeats(int seats) {
        this.seats = seats;
    }

    @Override
    public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    @Override
    public void setTransmission(Transmission transmission) {
        this.transmission = transmission;
    }

    @Override
    public void setTripComputer(TripComputer tripComputer) {
        this.tripComputer = tripComputer;
    }

    @Override
    public void setGPSNavigator(GPSNavigator gpsNavigator) {
        this.gpsNavigator = gpsNavigator;
    }

    public Car getResult() {
        return new Car(type, seats, engine, transmission, tripComputer, gpsNavigator);
    }
}

/**
 * Unlike other creational patterns, Builder can construct unrelated products,
 * which don't have the common interface.
 *
 * In this case we build a user manual for a car, using the same steps as we
 * built a car. This allows to produce manuals for specific car models,
 * configured with different features.
 */
public class CarManualBuilder implements Builder {
    private CarType type;
    private int seats;
    private Engine engine;
    private Transmission transmission;

    private GPSNavigator gpsNavigator;

    @Override
    public void setCarType(CarType type) {
        this.type = type;
    }

### Director

```java

        builder.setSeats(2);

### Client Demo

```java
public class Demo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Director director = new Director();

        // Director gets the concrete builder object from the client
        // (application code). That's because application knows better which
        // builder to use to get a specific product.
        CarBuilder builder = new CarBuilder();
        director.constructSportsCar(builder);

        // The final product is often retrieved from a builder object, since
        // Director is not aware and not dependent on concrete builders and
        // products.
        Car car = builder.getResult();
        System.out.println("Car built:\n" + car.getCarType());


        CarManualBuilder manualBuilder = new CarManualBuilder();

        // Director may know several building recipes.
        director.constructSportsCar(manualBuilder);
        Manual carManual = manualBuilder.getResult();
        System.out.println("\nCar manual built:\n" + carManual.print());
    }

}
