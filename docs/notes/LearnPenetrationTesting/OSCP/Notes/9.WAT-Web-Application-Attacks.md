# Web Application Attacks

## Web Application Enumeration

Interested:

1. Programming Language and Framework
2. Web Server Software
3. Database Software
4. Server OS

### Inspecting URLs

Some programming languages can be figured out from URLs/extensions, like php.

### Inspecting Page Content

From developer tool->debugger, we may find js library used.

### Viewing Response Header

Developer Tool => Network

Server Header could review Software running on server

### Inspecting Sitemaps

```bash
curl https://www.google.com/robots.txt
```

### Locating Admin Consoles





## Web Application Assessment Tools

### DIRB

Web Content Scanner. 

```bash
dirb <URL> -r -z 10		# -z 10 for delay   -r for non-recursive
```

### Burp Suite

`burpsuite` command.

Can be used to track requests send to a web server as a proxy, and regenerate these requests with custom settings.

For example, if some input doesn't allow more than 20 chars, we can use this method to surpass the check.

### Nikto

Web Server Scanner. Test dangerous/vulnerable files/programs/server version/config.

Could take very long.

Solution: 

1. set `-maxtime`
2. -T: to set type of test

```bash
nikto -host=http://www.megacorpone.com -maxtime=30s
```



## Exploiting Web-based Vulnerabilities

### Exploiting Admin Console

Use Nikto to find vulnerabilities, such as PHPmyAdmin, and guess its password



## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Identify XSS Vulnerabilities

Search input fields. 

Inject code into website (input) and they maybe executed as real scripts if not encoded/sanitized properly.



##  Directory Traversal Vulnerabilities

Gain access to files of a web app.

###  Identifying and Exploiting Directory Traversals

Examine URL query strings and forms.



## File Inclusion Vulnerabilities

Include a file into the application.



## SQL Injection

`sqlmap` for automating sql injection.
