# TCP vs UDP

## Scanning with metasploit and etc.

Not allowed in exam.

## Best Tool: nmap

TCP and UDP ports are the ports that we will scan.

### TCP

- Connection-oriented
- For app that require high reliability (HTTP, FTP, Telnet)
- Three-way handshake

### wireshark

### UDP

- Connection less
- For app that need fast connection (DNS, DHCP, SNMP)
- No Handshake
