# Glasswire

I learnt this app from Linux Tech Tips.

It's actually pretty good.

As of now, only Windows and Android are supported, and Mac support is coming.

There is free version and paid version.

## Free Version Functionalities

- Firewall
- What IP is each app communicating with
- Which app is communicating with internet
- Network Data Usage Monitoring (data used by each app)
