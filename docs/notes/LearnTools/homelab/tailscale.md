[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) is a VPN that provides similar functionality to [Cloudflare Tunnel + Warp](./Cloudflare/Tunnel.md), but eaiser (zero config). 

It's different from regular VPN where network traffic goes through a central server (as a proxy), tailscale uses a mesh network topology.
