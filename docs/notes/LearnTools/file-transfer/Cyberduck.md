>Cyberduck is a libre server and cloud storage browser for Mac and Windows with support for **FTP**, **SFTP**, **WebDAV**, **Amazon S3**, **OpenStack Swift**, **Backblaze B2**, **Microsoft Azure & OneDrive**, **Google Drive** and **Dropbox**.

It's free to use, but will alert to remind you to buy the app constantly.

I usually use the SFTP function to transfer files between my computers and servers.

It supports transfer files between 2 remote servers without first downloading files to the computer Cyberduck is running on.
