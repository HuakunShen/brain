# Online Editors

## Frontend

- [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/)
- [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)
- [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net)

Many frontend UI component libraries such as [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) use [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) and [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/) in their documentation to show a demo. Here is an [example](https://ant.design/components/button/), click on the icons below each component demo, an live editor will be open in another tab. All of them support generating workspace on the fly with a define API. Hundreds of UI component demos are not prebuilt and stored, but generated JIT by passing the source code to the online editors through a web request.
See Codesandbox's [Define API](https://codesandbox.io/docs/api#define-api) and CodePen's [Post to Prefill Editors](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/prefill/).

## General Purpose

- [vscode.dev](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/10/20/vscode-dev)
- [GitHub](https://github.dev)
  - In any GitHub repo (yours or others')
    - Hit the period key or change `github.com` to `github.dev` in url
  - Mostly used for previewing code in VSCode editor
  - I usually use the global search of VSCode to search for keyword in a repo
  - Making changes to your code in browser by git commit (no need to push)
- [codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/)
  - Paid service with no free option
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io)(**_recommended_**)
  - See [Gitpod.md](./Gitpod.md) for details

## Machine Learning

Machine learning requires very high computing power which CPUs can't qualify. Some platforms provide GPU and even TPU for user to write code in browser.

- [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
  - Probably the most popular choice
- [GCP AI Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/docs/technical-overview)
- [gradient](https://gradient.run/)
  - Free: 8 CPU, 30GB RAM, Quadrop M4000 8GB GPU
  - Pro has faster Free GPUs
  - Pro and Growth plan also has many other high-end GPU options (non-free)
  - See [Pricing](https://gradient.run/pricing) for more details
  - Select auth-shutdown, max 6 hours. Great because you have more control over time.
  - Free plan cannot have private project
  - Great choice for beginners
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)
- [JetBrains Datalore](https://datalore.jetbrains.com/)
  - Free version doesn't have GPU
  - Professional Version ($19.9/month) has 20 hours of GPU/month
