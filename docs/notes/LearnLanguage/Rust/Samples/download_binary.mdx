title: Download Binary File/Image (Rust)
---

```rust
use error_chain::error_chain;
use std::io::copy;
use std::fs::File;
use tempfile::Builder;
use std::io::Cursor;

error_chain! {
     foreign_links {
         Io(std::io::Error);
         HttpRequest(reqwest::Error);
     }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let tmp_dir = Builder::new().prefix("example").tempdir()?;
    let target = "https://www.rust-lang.org/logos/rust-logo-512x512.png";
    let response = reqwest::get(target).await?;

    let mut dest = {
        let fname = response
            .url()
            .path_segments()
            .and_then(|segments| segments.last())
            .and_then(|name| if name.is_empty() { None } else { Some(name) })
            .unwrap_or("tmp.bin");

        println!("file to download: '{}'", fname);
        // let fname = tmp_dir.path().join(fname); ! this line is commented out as temp files are removed on exit.
				// This will download the file in cwd, so we can verify the content.
        println!("will be located under: '{:?}'", fname);
        File::create(fname)?
    };
    // let content =  response.text().await?;
    // copy(&mut content.as_bytes(), &mut dest)?;

    let mut content =  Cursor::new(response.bytes().await?);
    copy(&mut content, &mut dest)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

The [Official Cook Book Sample Code](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/web/clients/download.html) is wrong.
Doesn't work. Instead of using `.text()`, use `.bytes()` and wrapped with `Cursor`.

`Cursor` is the main point. An experienced developer (but beginner in Rust) knows that converting binary file content to text then bytes is dangerous,
due to encoding issue; but wouldn't know about `Cursor`. 	

## Error Explained

`std::io::Read` requires `Read`, which `Bytes` doesn't have. So `Cursor` is needed.

Weird design for developer from another language.

```
the trait bound `bytes::bytes::Bytes: std::io::Read` is not satisfied
the trait `std::io::Read` is not implemented for `bytes::bytes::Bytes
main.rs(37, 5): required by a bound introduced by this call
copy.rs(55, 8): required by a bound in `std::io::copy`
No quick fixes available
```
