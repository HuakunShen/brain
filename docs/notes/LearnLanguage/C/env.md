To use a GUI IDE for easy development and debugging, my choices are Clion and VSCode.

- [Clion Setup for GCC](../../LearnTools/developer/IDE-Editor/Clion)
- [VSCode C/C++ Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
  - You can run/debug C/C++ program by clicking the run button
