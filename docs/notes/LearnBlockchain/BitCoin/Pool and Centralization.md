## Selfish Mining
Aka block-withholding. Don't annouce to network when a block is found. Keep working on the next block. If a second block is found, the network is fooled. Everyone in the network believes they are working on the longest chain, but you are.

When the network finds a block, you broadcast your two secret blocks and make the network block invalid. While the entire network is working on the invalid block, you are competing with no one (free time).

## Summary
- Large players have incentives to mine unhonestly
- Centralization -> Larger pool players cheat -> Smaller players kicked out -> More centralization
- Measures against mining attacks:
	- Miners switch pools to prevent monopoly
	- Punish cheaters in protocol (very hard)
- Comparing to mining attacks, double-spend attacks never occurred in the cryptocurrency history. Why? TODO.
- Bitcoin is increasingly centralized, network safety dependent on very few large players
