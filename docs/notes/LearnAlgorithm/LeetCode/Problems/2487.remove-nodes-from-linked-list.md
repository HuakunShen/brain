# 2487. Remove Nodes From Linked List

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nodes-from-linked-list/

**Level:** Medium

## Explanation

This is a simple problem but took me 30 minutes to solve. The keypoint is understand clearly the problem.

The requirement is "Remove every node which has a node with a greater value anywhere to the right side of it.

Which can be translated to

- No node to the right is greater than the current node
- No node to the left is smaller than the current node

Which can be further translated to

- Turn the linked list into a decreasing linked list

**Decreasing Linked List** is the key characteristic of the linked list we want to return.

**Time:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

## Recursion

Then with recursion we can easily solve this problem. We assume the returned linked list must be decreasing.

If current node is greater than the first node in the returned linked list, attach the returned linked list to the current node and return the current node. So it's still decreasing.

If current node is smaller than the returned linked list, return the returned linked list. (Skip the current node)

Base case is when the current node is `None`, `return None`.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if head is None:
            return None
        ret = self.removeNodes(head.next)
        if ret is None:
            return head
        if ret.val > head.val:
            return ret
        head.next = ret
        return head
```

## Stack

If recursion is not allowed, another intuitive way is to use stack/array.

We want a decreasing linked list, everything to the right must be smaller, but we don't know what's on the right.

With a regular array we can use index to iterate from right to left. So let's simplify this problem to a regular array.

"_Remove all nodes in an array that prevent it to be decreasing._"

### Example 1

```python
a = [5,2,13,3,8]
b = []
max_so_far = 0
for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
    if a[i] >= max_so_far:
        max_so_far = a[i]
        b.append(a[i])
print(b)        # [8, 13]
b.reverse()
print(b)        # [13, 8]
```

The problem is, with a linked list, we can't iterate from right to left.

So we reverse the array first so we can iterate from left to right.

### Example 2

```python
a = [5,2,13,3,8]
b = []

a.reverse()
max_so_far = 0
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] >= max_so_far:
        max_so_far = a[i]
        b.insert(0, a[i])
print(b)        # [13, 8]
```

In the case of linked list, we can use a stack to reverse.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        stack = []
        cur = head
        while cur:          # construct the stack
            stack.append(cur)
            cur = cur.next
        cur = stack.pop()
        mx = cur.val
        ret = ListNode(mx)
        while stack:        # iterate from left to right
            cur = stack.pop()
            if cur.val < mx:
                continue
            else:
                new_node = ListNode(cur.val)
                new_node.next = ret     # insert current node to the left of linked list
                ret = new_node
                mx = cur.val
        return ret
```

## Reverse Twice

In [Explanation](#explanation) we understood the nature of this problem: make the linked list decreasing order.

If we think from the groud up, this problem can be divided into 2 subproblems:

1. Make a linked list increasing
2. Reverse a linked list
   1. This is simple, it's LeetCode [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/). Using 3 pointers to reverse a linked list in place is one option.

> Note: Here when I say "making a linked list increasing or decreasing", I am not talk about sorting, but removing the nodes that are not in the right order.

> If we reverse the linked list and make it increasing, then reverse it back. This make it decreasing.

You may ask, why not just make it decreasing directly? The reason is, in the context of linked list and this problem. It's easier to make it increasing.

With a linked list, it's easy to keep the `head` and manipulate the rest of the linked list, then return `head`.

In the increasing linked list problem (no node to the right should be smaller than nodes on the left), we can easily remove the nodes that are not in the right order. If the current node is smaller than previous node, remove the current node. **Most importantly, the head will never be removed because there is no node to its left**.

To make decreasing linked list, if current node is greater than the previous node, remove the current node. The problem is, **the rightmost node should always be kept because there is no node to the right of it. And the head should be able to be removed as all nodes are to the right of it**.

This is why we need to reverse the linked list.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverse_list(self, head):
        prev = None
        current = head
        next_temp = None

        while current:
            next_temp = current.next
            current.next = prev
            prev = current
            current = next_temp
        return prev

    def increasing_order(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        maximum = 0
        cur = head
        prev = None
        while cur:
            maximum = max(maximum, cur.val)
            if cur.val < maximum:
                prev.next = cur.next
                # deleted = cur         # this line is optional
                cur = cur.next
                # deleted.next = None   # this line is optional
            else:
                prev = cur
                cur = cur.next
        return head     # head is the rightmost node and could never be removed

    def removeNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        rev = self.reverse_list(head)
        increasing = self.increasing_order(rev)
        decreasing = self.reverse_list(increasing)
        return decreasing
```

## Conclusion

This problem is simple but tricky. The key is to understand the nature of the problem.

Solving it with recursion is the most elegant way. But if recursion is not allowed, we can use stack or reverse twice.

Recursion can have depth limit and introduces overhead. If the linked list can be super long the other options could be better.
