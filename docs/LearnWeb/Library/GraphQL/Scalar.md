title: GraphQL Scalar
---

GraphQL has limited built-in scalar types. You can define your own scalar types.

> The method and library to use depends on the GraphQL framework you are using.

See this for how to define your own scalar types in apollo.

## Scalar Library

Of course there are libraries that provide common scalar types. Simply add them to your resolver.
