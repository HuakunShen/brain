title: Shadcn

Tailwind is my favorite css library. Shadcn is based on it. Instead of importing the components as a black box, shadcn generate a file for you that you can modify, giving more freedom.

It's also one of the best looking library.

The original library was only in react, but there are community maintained Vue and Svelte versions.

## React (Original)

## Vue

## Svelte

The svelte version has less features. For example, there is no toast component.
