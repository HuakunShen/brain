# Migration

[Prisma Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate)

> Prisma Migrate is an imperative database schema migration tool that enables you to:
>
> - Keep your database schema in sync with your Prisma schema as it evolves and
> - Maintain existing data in your database

> Prisma Migrate generates a history of .sql migration files, and plays a role in both development and deployment.

# CLI

[Prisma CLI reference](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/command-reference)

## db pull

`prisma db pull`

[db pull](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/command-reference#db-pull)

> The db pull command connects to your database and adds Prisma models to your Prisma schema that reflect the current database schema.

See [Introspection](#introspection) section.

## db push

`prisma db push`

[db push](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/command-reference#db-push)

> The db push command pushes the state of your Prisma schema file to the database without using migrations. It creates the database if the database does not exist.

If you made some changes to your Prisma schema, you need to run `prisma generate` first and `prisma db push` to update the database. Otherwise changes like `@unique` property will not be updated to DB. Note, you may also want to use Migration if it's an update but not an initialization.

Read [Choosing db push or Prisma Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/db-push#choosing-db-push-or-prisma-migrate).

**Short answer: don't use it in production.**

## Migration

`prisma migrate dev`

Similar to also different from `db push`.

> The migrate dev command updates your database using migrations during development and creates the database if it does not exist.

MongoDB not supported.
