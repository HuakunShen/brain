# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

See [Doc](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)

Create IAM users for different permissions, limited access to a specific resource, such as read only S3 bucket.

Access tokens are generated, and can be used in applications. Access tokens can also be used with [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
