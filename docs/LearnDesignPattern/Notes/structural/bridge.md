# What

> **Bridge** is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—**abstraction** and **implementation**—which can be developed independently of each other.

# Why





# Where

>  The Bridge pattern is especially useful when dealing with cross-platform apps, supporting multiple types of database servers or working with several API providers of a certain kind (for example, cloud platforms, social networks, etc.)
