[ACID - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) means ([atomicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems) "Atomicity (database systems)"), [consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_(database_systems) "Consistency (database systems)"), [isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems) "Isolation (database systems)"), [durability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durability_(database_systems) "Durability (database systems)"))
It's a set of database properties for guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. Relational databases usually have ACID, while some non-SQL databases decides to use BASE model to achieve high availability and scalability by lossen the ACID requirements.
