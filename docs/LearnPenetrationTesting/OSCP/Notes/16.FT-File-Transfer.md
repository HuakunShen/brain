# File Transfer

## Dangers of Transfering Attack Tools

Transferring attack tools to target machines could be dangerous.



## Install Pure-FTPD

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install pure-ftpd -y
```

It's a FTP server running on the attack machine, hosting files to be downloaded.

## The Non-Interactive Shell

```bash
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'	# solution, run this after netcat connection to get a regular shell
```



## Transferring Files With Windows Hosts

Windows machine don't usually have the necessary tools such as wget netcat or curl. Thus we need a method to transfer necessary tools to Windows machine.

### Non-Interactive FTP Download

Windows has a pre-installed FTP client that can be used for file transfers.

Host a FTP server on the attack machine and download files from the attack machine on Windows.



### Windows Downloads Using Scripting Languages

VB Script or PowerShell.

Run VB Script of PowerShell script to simulate a wget, and use the script to download files.

Use reverse shell to control target machine and create an executable.

Run the executable to download files from FTP server.



### Windows Downloads with exe2hex and PowerShell



### Windows Uploads Using Windows Scripting Languages

Upload files from target machine to attack machine.



### Uploading Files With TFTP

```bash
sudo apt -y install atftp
```

Create a dir to serve files and configure its permissions.

```bash
sudo mkdir /tftp
sudo chown nobody: /tftp
sudo atftpd --daemon --port 69 /tftp
```
