# Bash

## Declare Var

```bash
variable=10
str=Hello World		# wrong
str="Hello World"	# correct 
str='Hello World'	# correct
```

**Single Quote:** interprets every enclosed character literally

**Double Quote:** all characters are viewed literally except "$", "`", and "\" meaning variables will be expanded in an initial substitution pass on the enclosed text

`$()`: **Command Substitution**, set the value of the variable to the result of a command or program

``: **Command Substitution**, The *backtick* method is older and typically discouraged as there are differences in how the two methods of command substitution behave

| Variable Name | Description                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| $0            | The name of the Bash Script                      |
| $1-$9         | The first 9 arguments to the Bash Script         |
| $#            | Number of arguments passed to the Bash Script    |
| $@            | All arguments passed to the Bash Script          |
| $?            | The exit status of the most recently run process |
| $$            | The process ID of the current script             |
| $USER         | The username of the user running the script      |
| $HOSTNAME     | The hostname of the machine                      |
| $RANDOM       | A random number                                  |
| $LINENO       | The current line number in the script            |

## Read User Input

```bash
echo "Hello there, would you like to learn how to hack: Y/N?" 
read answer 
echo "Your answer was $answer"
```

```bash
read -p 'Username: ' username 	# -p allows us to specify a prompt
read -sp 'Password: ' password 	# -s makes the user input silent
echo "Thanks, your creds are as follows: " $username " and " $password 
```



# Conditional Statements

```bash
if [ <some test> ] 		# [ ] square bracket can be replaced by test
then   
	<perform action> 
elif [ <some test> ] 
then   
	<perform different action> 
else   
	<perform yet another different action> 
fi 
```

| Operator              | Desciption: Expression True of...      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| !EXPRESSION           | The EXPRESSION is false                |
| -n STRING             | STRING length is greater than zero     |
| -z STRING             | The length of STRING is zero (empty)   |
| STRING1 != STRING2    | STRING1 is not equal to STRING2        |
| STRING1 = STRING2     | STRING1 is equal to STRING2            |
| INTEGER1 -eq INTEGER2 | Equal                                  |
| INTEGER1 -ne INTEGER2 | Not Equal                              |
| INTEGER1 -gt INTEGER2 | Greater Than                           |

| INTEGER1 -ge INTEGER2 | >=                                     |
| INTEGER1 -le INTEGER2 | <=                                     |
| -d FILE               | FILE exists and is a dir               |
| -e FILE               | FILE exists                            |
| -r FILE               | FILE exists and has read permission    |
| -s FILE               | FILE exists and it is not empty        |
| -w FILE               | FILE exists and has write permission   |
| -x FILE               | FILE exists and has execute permission |



## Logic Operator

```bash
grep $USER /etc/passwd && echo "$USER found!"		# the second half is executed iff the first half is True
grep $user2 /etc/passwd && echo "$user2 found!" || echo "$user2 not found !" #  when grep does not find a matching line and returns False, the second echo command after the OR (||) operator is executed instead. 
```



## Loops

```bash
for var-name in <list>
do
	<action to perform> 
done
```

```bash
for ip in $(seq 1 10); do echo 10.11.1.$ip; done 
for i in {1..10}; do echo 10.11.1.$i;done 
```

```bash
while [ <some test> ]
d
<perform an action>
done
```

```bash
counter=1
while [ $counter -lt 10 ] 
do
	echo "10.11.1.$counter"
	((counter++))				# The ((counter++)) line uses the double-parenthesis (( )) construct to perform arithmetic expansion and evaluation at the same time
done 
```

## Functions

```bash
# format 1
function func_name {
...
}

# format 2
func_name () {
...
}

# function example 
print_me () {
	echo "You have been printed!"
} 
print_me

# function example 2
pass_arg() {
	echo "Today's random number is: $1"			# $1 is the passed in argument
} 
 
pass_arg $RANDOM
```

## Scope

By default, a variable has a global scope, meaning it can be accessed throughout the entire script. 

A local variable can only be seen within the function, block of code, or subshell in which it is defined.

```bash
local name="Joe" 
```
