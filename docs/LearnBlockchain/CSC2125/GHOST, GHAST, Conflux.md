**Goal of Conflux:** Realize the hardware potential with a scalable consensus protocol.

## GHOST
GHOST is Weak to liveness Attacks. When block generation rate is high, attacker can hypothetically stall blockchain consensus by balancing 2 branches (prevent consensus). 

## GHAST (Greedy Heaviest Adaptive SubTree)
Assign different weights to generated blocks to break the balance in order to make progress. 
In normal scenarios, assign equal weights to blocks.
- Operate like GHOST
When attack happens, assign **high weights** to a small subset of blocks
- Operate like structured GHOST approaches
- Ensure consensus progress
