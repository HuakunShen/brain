## Mining Pool
Groups of miners, increase chance of finding blocks. 

Define $\alpha$ to be the percentage of mining power owned by a selfish miner.
Define $\gamma$ to be the probability the chain is chosen (propagation probability).
Revenue formula
$$R_{pool}=\frac{r_{pool}}{r_{other} + r_{pool}}$$


Plot and find the intersect between honest strategy and selfish strategy curve, more revenue can be gained when computing power is more than 33%.
