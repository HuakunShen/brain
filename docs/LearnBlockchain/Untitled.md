## Consensus
New blockchain systems are based on these solutions
- DAG: Change strucutre to allow more inherent parallization inside the protocol
- Committee BFT: reduce the number of consensus participants and run modified BFT to generate blocks
- Sharding: Sacrifice the security to allow transactions to be verified by part of the network
