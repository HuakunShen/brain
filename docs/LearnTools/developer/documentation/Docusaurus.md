- multiple fulltext search tools
- plugins (math equation)
- beautiful code blocks and all kinds of nice built-in components

## Search

[Algolia DocSearch](./DocSearch) is nice but I can't get feed back from them. So I used [docusaurus-search-local](https://github.com/easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local) theme. It provides offline search support. Basically, the search index is built while `npm run build`.

It's super easy to use. Just `npm install` the package and add the package to the theme.
