> A quick file/image uploaded built with Tauri (Rust + SvelteKit)


- Main purpose: a imagebed client, I use it for writing blog and notes in Markdown
    - I take screenshot all the time, saving screenshots as files and moving them is too time consuming, and takes lots of space in git repo.
    - Images from other website can also to uploaded to my own imagebed as a mirror, in case original images were removed, then references on my website will expire too.
