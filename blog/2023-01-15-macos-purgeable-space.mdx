## Problem Description

I encountered a weird problem with MacOS storage.

I wanted to install a MacOS VM with Parallels Desktop, but was unable to. The error message says I don't have enough space (at least 49.13G) on disk.
But storage displayed in preference tells me I have more than 500GB of space, and I just cleaned the storage.

Although preference says that I have space, other places give me different result.

`df -h .` says my disk usage is 97%

In disk utility, my disk usage is displayed to be 942.28/994.66GB.

Right click on the disk -> `Get Info`. The purgeable space section takes ~500GB of space.

Usually, Mac should handle it. Space should be freed while needed, but not here. 

MacOS doesn't seem to provide a option to manually purge space, so I have to use a third party software. 

How stupid is this?
